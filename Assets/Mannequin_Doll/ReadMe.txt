==============================

1) WHAT IS INCLUDED
Within this package you have:
-The mannequin doll model (.FBX)
-The mannequin doll Subtance for the texture (.SBSAR) (Each version has their own version)
-The setup doll as a prefab
-The setup doll with a ragdoll as a prefab

2) SETUP
In order to use the mannequin model please use one of the included prefabs. You can change any of the import settings in the .fbx file if you wish 
to use mesh compression or any of the other options in there.

With the substance you can change several details of the mannequins appearance. You can find these by clicking on the .sbsar file and the sliders
will appear in the inspector. 

3) TIPS & TRICKS
You can always use animations with the ragdoll model! Add your Animator Controller and ensure the Animator component is enabled.
If you wish for the model to become lifeless again just disable the Animator component in your script and it will become a ragdoll!
(You may need to make all Rigidbodies in it's heirarchy Kinematic while the Animator is active, to prevent weird physics)

Remember as it is a Substance Texture you can make endless variations of the texture by pressing the "+" or duplicate button in the inspector when the 
substance is selected.

If you plan on using the model as a character then you will need additional animations. Check out the Mixamo store if you don't have any already!
